Quantum computing has the potential to solve very complex problems, but there is also a high potential for failures along the way. Noise is a phenomenon that disturbs the process of executing quantum tasks. Our goal was to isolate the spectrum function of noise that occurs during quantum tasks, otherwise considered as energy, and manipulate the noise to extract audio information in order to create a wave function. After generating the wave function, we passed it through the fft and attempted to transform it into music.
